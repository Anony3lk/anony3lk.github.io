Shoutouts to Laiite for fixing this to work on Chrome

Info:
- Reset button loacted at bottom left
- Skills show up in Cumulative, so I would recommend avoiding those edicts until the end to avoid cluttering, if you want to add the cost of those edicts to the totals


Post any issues (hopefully none) but I can't promise that I will fix any of it. Sorry.

Feel free to copy the code and modify it to your liking (Good luck if you do)

If you found use from this, or even enjoyed using it (somehow), I'm very glad :)
